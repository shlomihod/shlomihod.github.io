I'm a CS Ph.D. candidate at Boston University, under the supervision of [Prof. Ran Canetti](https://www.bu.edu/cs/profiles/ran-canetti/). Since September 2023, I have been visiting Columbia University to collaborate with [Prof. Rachel Cummings](https://rachelcummings.com).


I'm working on Responsible AI, and my current interests include:

1. Designing differentially private synthetic data for use in government and medical contexts
1. The co-design of computer science and law, focusing on privacy and fairness
1. Supporting policymakers in developing effective AI policies

In February 2024, together with the Israeli Ministry of Health, we released a [differentially private synthetic dataset](https://birth.dataset.pub) of the National Live Birth Registry.

For the last few years, I have taught courses in [Responsible AI, Law, Ethics & Society](https://learn.responsibly.ai/) in various institutes including Boston University, Cornell Tech, Bocconi University, Tel Aviv University and the Technion. Our materials are available for faculty [here](https://teach.responsibly.ai/). In August 2023, I taught a two-day [congressional workshop](https://gov.responsibly.ai) for US Congress staffers based on our course.

In summer 2022, I interned at Twitter Cortex where I leveraged human-in-the-loop research to improve toxicity models. In 2020-2021, I was an Associated Researcher at the [Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society (HIIG)](https://www.hiig.de/en/) in Berlin. In summer 2019, I did a research internship at the [Center for Human-Compatible AI](https://humancompatible.ai/) at UC Berkeley, working on neural network interpretability. 

In my previous life, I was a social entrepreneur - co-founder of the [Israeli Cyber Education Center](https://cyber.org.il/about-us-eng/). There I led the development of nationwide educational programs in computing for kids and teens. The center aims to increase the social mobility of underrepresented groups in tech, such as women, minorities, and individuals from the suburbs of Israel. I co-authored a [Computer Network textbook](https://data.cyber.org.il/networks/networks.pdf) in a tutorial approach (in Hebrew). 
Before that, I was an algorithmic research team leader in cybersecurity.
