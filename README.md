I'm a senior researcher at the [German Institute of Employment Research (IAB)](https://iab.de/en/home-2/) and an associate researcher at [Weizenbaum Institute](https://www.weizenbaum-institut.de/en/). I recently completed my CS Ph.D. at Boston University, under the supervision of Prof. Ran Canetti.

I'm working on **deployable responsible computing**. My current research interests include:

1. Technical tools for AI governance
2. Toolbox of differential privacy for real-world deployment 
3. Supporting evidence-based AI policymaking

In February 2024, together with the Israeli Ministry of Health, we released a [differentially private synthetic dataset](https://birth.dataset.pub) of the National Live Birth Registry.

For the last few years, I have taught courses in [Responsible AI, Law, Ethics & Society](https://learn.responsibly.ai/) at various institutions including Boston University, UC Berkeley, Cornell Tech, Bocconi University, Tel Aviv University and the Technion. Our materials are available for faculty [here](https://teach.responsibly.ai/). In August 2023, I taught a two-day [congressional](https://www.bu.edu/hic/2023/08/30/shlomi-hod-leads-congressional-workshop-on-responsible-ai/) [workshop](https://gov.responsibly.ai/23-congress/) for US Congress staffers based on our course.

During the summer of 2024, I was an [OpenDP](https://opendp.org) fellow at Harvard University. Between September 2023 and August 2024, I visited Columbia University to collaborate with Prof. Rachel Cummings. In the summer of 2022, I interned at Twitter Cortex where I leveraged human-in-the-loop research to improve toxicity models. In 2020-2021, I was an Associated Researcher at the [Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society (HIIG)](https://www.hiig.de/en/) in Berlin. In the summer of 2019, I did a research internship at the [Center for Human-Compatible AI](https://humancompatible.ai/) at UC Berkeley, working on neural network interpretability. 

In my previous life, I was a social entrepreneur - co-founder of the [Israeli Cyber Education Center](https://cyber.org.il/about-us-eng/). There, I led the development of nationwide educational programs in computing for kids and teens. The center aims to increase social mobility of underrepresented groups in tech, such as women, minorities, and individuals from the suburbs of Israel. I co-authored a [Computer Network textbook](https://data.cyber.org.il/networks/networks.pdf) with a tutorial approach (in Hebrew). 
Before that, I was an algorithmic research team leader in cybersecurity.
